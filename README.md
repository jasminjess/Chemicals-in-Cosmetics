This dataset contains information on chemicals used in cosmetics, including the name of the chemical, the company that uses it, the category of cosmetics it is used in, and the date it was first reported. 
- Data Source: Downloaded from www.kaggle.com
- Project Tool: SQL & Tableau

In this project, I used sql to analyze cosmetics data to find out the following:

- Most-used chemicals in manufacturing personal care products.
- Chemicals reported and discontinued.
- Companies that used the most reported chemicals in their cosmetics and personal care products, and
- Brands that had chemicals removed and discontinued.
